      <h2 class="third"> Introduction to golf: </h2>
        <p> Golf is both a mental and physical sport.  The physical aspect of the sport includes perfecting the 'swing mechanics', the mental aspect of golf tests the concentration, focus and 'course management'.  It requires a golf bag, a set of golf clubs, balls and tees to play.  On the most basic level, the goal of golf is to swing at your golf ball with your golf club and achieve the lowest score/ number of strokes possible.  Various golf clubs are lofted differently and will consequently go different distances.</p>
